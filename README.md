This was the first project I completed. It is an Android app made as a tribute to one of the greatest actors of Italian comedy movies, 
Franco Lechner, AKA [Bombolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombolo).  

The app features playable samples of some of **Bombolo’s most famous lines** from the many movies he took part in.  

The app also shows a portrait of Bombolo, which you can click on. Every time the portrait is clicked the picture will change to show some of 
Bombolo’s most typical **facial expressions**, and also a random audio sample will be played.

There are around 20 audio samples and 10 different pictures in the app.
